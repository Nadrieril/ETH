    This course introduce the fundamental notions of groups and group actions, which formalize the idea of symetry in mathematics.
    We will first study basic facts of finite groups (Sylow theory, extension and composition sequence, decomposition in simple groups).
    We will then introduce the general notion of a module over a ring A (non necessarily commutative), and consider two cases where one knows how to classify modules over A: when A is principal and when A is semisimple.
