    Randomness plays a key role in numerous engineering applications, like system reliability, telecommunications or image recognition. In practice, data collected at different times are often modeled by random variables for which one would like to predict their behavior.
    The goal of this course is to formalize these concepts and to present two fundamental random processes : Markov chains and Martingales. The theory will be illustrated by various applications (PageRank, simulated annealing, ...).
