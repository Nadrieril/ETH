    This course introduces the formalism of distributions, which is a natural context to study the Fourier transform and partial differential equations.
    Contents:
    - Distributions, differenciation, convolution, regularization;
    - Fourier transform;
    - Poisson and Laplace equations. Harmonic functions;
    - Heat equation;
    - Wave equations and Schrödinger equations.
