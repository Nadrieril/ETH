    Bilingual students or students with a very high english level can participate in a tutoring program instead of taking a regular English course.
    Each tutor meets up with 2 tutees twice a week (at least 30 minutes per meeting), and they have informal conversations in english about the topics of their choice.
    The tutors will be evaluated from a written report about their pedagogic work and their tutees' progression.
