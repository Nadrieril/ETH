    This course presents the foundations of Informatics as a scientific discipline.
    This course identifies the framework of what can or cannot be done, in terms of computability and complexity.

    Propositional and predicate logic : Formulae, models, satisfiability, validity, provability
    Examples of theories: arithmetic and set theory
    Computational model: Turing machines, computability, decidability, the halting problem, universal machine
    Complexity classes: P, NP, problem reduction, NP-completeness

    Algorithms are the heart of all computation.
    Having followed this course, the student will have a profound knowledge of the most central algorithms, both understanding how and why they work and being able to reduce other computational problems to these building blocks.
    In addition to this, we shall also give a brief introduction to several recent topics like randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, online algorithms, or algorithmic game theory.

    In real-life applications, there is a need for modularity and encapsulation to ease the creation of large programs.
    We will study the tools and abstractions needed for that through practicals.
